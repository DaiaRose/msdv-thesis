Abstract draft

Many American adults enter adulthood with knowledge gaps that impact their sexual health, relationships, and overall well-being. Topics they most wish to learn coincide with content inconsistently addressed in American K-12 schools, many of which emphasize abstinence-only approaches. These topics include body image, recognizing abuse, LGBTQ+ issues, consent, pleasure, and reproductive health. 
In an age of information overload, answers and wrong answers to people's most curious questions are readily available; which presents many avenues for continuing education, as well as risk for the spread of misinformation. American adults bridge sex education gaps through independent research, peer discussions, media consumption, and access to professionals; each method influenced by social, cultural, and technological factors. 
Digital resources, such as social media, YouTube, podcasts, and websites, serve as primary self-education tools. Conversations with friends, family, and partners offer informal learning opportunities, often influenced by cultural and generational attitudes toward sex. Media representations in television, film, and books also shape public understanding of sex and relationships. Additionally, healthcare professionals and sex educators provide expert guidance, though barriers such as cost, stigma, and accessibility impact their reach.
The expansion of education resources plays a crucial role in promoting comprehensive sexual literacy. By providing accessible, accurate, and inclusive information, these resources empower individuals to make informed decisions about their sexual health, relationships, and well-being. By understanding the ways adults bridge gaps from K-12 sex education, we can highlight the need for accurate, accessible, and inclusive sex education throughout life.
