Intro
American adults seek informal sex education through media resources to fill in knowledge gaps on key topics. These topics include body image, recognizing abuse, LGBTQ+ issues, consent, pleasure, and reproductive health. Often these same topics were inconsistently or inadequately addressed in K-12 education, where abstinence-only curricula remain common. This project explores how adults navigate these gaps through independent research, peer discussions, media consumption, and professional guidance, highlighting the broader implications of informal sex education.
The inspiration for this project stems from the growing accessibility of digital information, which provides both opportunities and challenges in sexual health education. While the internet, social media, podcasts, and other digital resources have democratized access to information, they have also facilitated the spread of misinformation. This project examines how adults engage with these resources and supplement their learning through conversations with peers and professional guidance. In doing so, it aims to answer key questions: How do American adults compensate for the shortcomings of their formal sex education? What topics do they seek most? What role do different sources—digital, interpersonal, and professional—play in shaping sexual literacy?
The U.S. has dynamic political and societal attitudes as reflected in state curricula including a history of debate around comprehensive approaches to sex education. It also has a history of non-governmental resources, significantly Planned Parenthood, providing education in tandem with and beyond the typical school setting. 
By understanding these dynamics, this project underscores the need for lifelong, accessible, and inclusive sex education. While it does not attempt to propose a singular solution to the limitations of K-12 curricula, it aims to shed light on the ways individuals educate themselves and the broader implications of these informal learning processes.






Abstract draft

Many American adults enter adulthood with knowledge gaps that impact their sexual health, relationships, and overall well-being. Topics they most wish to learn coincide with content inconsistently addressed in American K-12 schools, many of which emphasize abstinence-only approaches. These topics include body image, recognizing abuse, LGBTQ+ issues, consent, pleasure, and reproductive health. 
In an age of information overload, answers and wrong answers to people's most curious questions are readily available; which presents many avenues for continuing education, as well as risk for the spread of misinformation. American adults bridge sex education gaps through independent research, peer discussions, media consumption, and access to professionals; each method influenced by social, cultural, and technological factors. 
Digital resources, such as social media, YouTube, podcasts, and websites, serve as primary self-education tools. Conversations with friends, family, and partners offer informal learning opportunities, often influenced by cultural and generational attitudes toward sex. Media representations in television, film, and books also shape public understanding of sex and relationships. Additionally, healthcare professionals and sex educators provide expert guidance, though barriers such as cost, stigma, and accessibility impact their reach.
The expansion of education resources plays a crucial role in promoting comprehensive sexual literacy. By providing accessible, accurate, and inclusive information, these resources empower individuals to make informed decisions about their sexual health, relationships, and well-being. By understanding the ways adults bridge gaps from K-12 sex education, we can highlight the need for accurate, accessible, and inclusive sex education throughout life.
